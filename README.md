Machine Learning Project_Spring2017

This project built a music recommendation system based on the predicted score of rating on a specific song for a user.

We used Spark to run Alternating Least Squares, Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Gradient Boosted Regression and XGBoost Regression.
